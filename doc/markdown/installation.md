# Installation

If you use Linux or OS X, then all dependencies can be installed either through a package manager or by OMPL's build system. In other words, you probably don't have to compile dependencies from source.

To compile OMPL the following two packages are required:
- [Boost], version 1.54 or higher, and
- [CMake], version 2.8.7 or higher.

The build system includes a [number of options](buildOptions.html) that you can enable or disable. To be able to generate python bindings you need to install the [Python] library and header files.

Below are more detailed installation instructions for [Linux](#install_linux), [OS X](#install_osx), and [Windows](#install_windows).

\note If you are using [ROS], please see [MoveIt!][moveit].

# Installation on Linux {#install_linux}

## Ubuntu Linux {#install_linux_ubuntu}

###  Installation from repositories

Starting with Ubuntu 14.04, you can install OMPL like so

    apt-get install libompl-dev ompl-demos

Debian packages for the latest version of OMPL are also found in ROS distributions (they might be newer than the standard Ubuntu ompl packages). All you need to do is add the ROS repository to your list of sources (you probably have added this already if you are using ROS):

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
    wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

and install OMPL:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ros-`rosversion -d`-ompl


### Installation from source

- Install Boost, CMake, and optional dependencies

      sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev cmake doxygen graphviz python-dev libeigen3-dev libode-dev

- If you want Python bindings or a GUI, [install Py++ and its dependencies](installPyPlusPlus.html).
- Create a build directory and run cmake:

      cd ompl
      mkdir -p build/Release
      cd build/Release
      cmake ../..

- Optionally, generate the Python bindings with `make -j 4 update_bindings`.
- Compile OMPL by typing `make -j 4`.
- Optionally, run the test programs by typing `make test`.
- Optionally, generate documentation by typing `make doc`.
- If you need to install the library, you can type `sudo make install`. The install location is specified by `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. If you install in a non-standard location, you have to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the directory where the OMPL python module is installed (e.g., $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages).

### Installation from source for use with ROS

If you'd like to use your own build of OMPL with ROS, follow the following steps:
- [Create a normal ROS catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)
- [Clone OMPL into the src/ folder](\ref download_repos)
- Add the package.xml file:

      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-gbp/ompl-release/debian/`rosversion -d`/`lsb_release -cs`/ompl/package.xml

- To build, you must run catkin_make_isolated instead of the normal catkin_make since OMPL is not a normal catkin package.
- When sourcing this workspace, be sure to source devel_isolated/setup.bash.

## Fedora Linux

Simply type:

    sudo yum install ompl

## Debian Linux

Simply type:

    sudo apt-get install libompl-dev ompl-demos


# Installation on Mac OS X {#install_osx}

It is easiest to install OMPL through either [MacPorts] or [HomeBrew], two package managers for OS X. Note that the HomeBrew package does not include the Python bindings for OMPL.

## MacPorts {#install_macports}

Install [MacPorts] and type:

    sudo port sync \; install ompl

Demo programs can be found in `/opt/local/share/ompl`.

## Homebrew {#install_homebrew}

Install [Homebrew] and type:

    brew install ompl

# Installation on Windows {#install_windows}

\note It is possible to run OMPL natively on Windows, although it must be stressed that __extensive testing on Windows is not performed__ at this time, and running OMPL on Windows is considered _highly_ experimental. It is _much_ easier to install [VirtualBox], create an Ubuntu virtual machine, and follow the Ubuntu installation directions above.

For best performance, the [MinGW] compiler is recommended. Visual Studio can also be used to build the core OMPL library, but currently it is not possible to generate the python bindings for OMPL with this compiler. However, if the bindings are generated with MinGW, the bindings can be compiled by Visual Studio with some minor tweaks to the code (not recommended, unless you are an experienced Windows developer).


## Required Dependencies

- [CMake], version 2.8.7 or higher,
- [MinGW][] (recommended) or Visual Studio compiler, and
- [Boost], version 1.54 or greater.

  It is recommended to make a complete Boost compilation from source.  If using Visual Studio, this process can be automated using the [BoostPro](http://www.boostpro.com/download) installer. Once complete, set the environment variables `BOOST_ROOT` and `BOOST_LIBRARYDIR` to the locations where Boost and its libraries are installed.  The default locations are `C:\\Boost` and `C:\\Boost\\lib`.  Ensure that `BOOST_LIBRARYDIR` is also in the system PATH so that any necessary Boost dlls are loaded properly at runtime.


## Optional Dependencies (for Python bindings)

- A __32-bit__ version of [Python] 2.7.  Ensure that this is installed __before building Boost__ so that Boost.Python is properly compiled.
- Ensure that Python is added to the system `PATH`.
- Py++: To generate the Python bindings, Py++ and its dependencies must be installed. Instructions can be found [here](installPyPlusPlus.html).


## Build

- Once the dependencies are installed, CMake can be used to generate MinGW makefiles or a Visual Studio solution
by specifying a specific GENERATOR:

    cd ompl
    mkdir build
    cd build
    mkdir Release
    cd Release
    cmake -G "GENERATOR" ../.. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install]

The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable is set to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ompl` by default.

### MinGW
- The CMake generator for MinGW is `"MinGW Makefiles"`
- To generate the python bindings (optional), execute the update_bindings make command before compiling:

      mingw32-make update_bindings

  __Note:__ `update_bindings` is _never_ run automatically. If you change any of the OMPL header files, you need to regenerate the bindings for the changes to be reflected in the Python modules. See also the [more detailed documentation on generating python bindings](\ref updating_python_bindings).
- Use `mingw32-make` to build OMPL.
- If you wish to install OMPL, use the install command to copy the binaries, demo code, and other resources to the cmake install prefix.  Note that you will need to be in a shell with administrator privileges to install to the default directory.

      mingw32-make install

- Make sure to add the install path's \\lib subdirectory to the PATH so that the DLLs are found when code is loaded.


### Visual Studio
- The CMake generator for Visual Studio depends on the version of Visual Studio to generate a solution for. The generator for VS 2010 is `"Visual Studio 10"`, and the generator for VS 2008 is `"Visual Studio 9 2008"`. Consult the CMake documentation for other generators.
- Open ompl.sln and build the solution.  A static library will be created (ompl.lib) to link your code against, as well as several demo programs.
- You can install OMPL by building the "INSTALL" project inside of the solution.  Note that this will attempt to copy files to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ompl` (the default).  The installation will fail unless Visual Studio is opened with administrator privileges, or a non-system install prefix is specified when cmake is run.
